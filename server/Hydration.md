# React Hydration

React hydration is the process of adding client-side JavaScript interactivity to pre-rendered static HTML generated by the server. It's a crucial technique for **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, enhancing initial rendering speed and improving SEO.

**Purpose:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** Hydration connects the static HTML from the server with the dynamic React application on the client.
* **Enhanced User Experience:** It provides a faster initial page load, as users see content immediately.
* **SEO Benefits:** Search engines can easily crawl and index the pre-rendered HTML.

**How it Works:**

1.  **Server-Side Rendering:**
    * React renders the application into static HTML on the server (e.g., using `renderToString`).
    * This HTML is sent to the client's browser.
2.  **Client-Side Hydration:**
    * The browser displays the static HTML.
    * React's `hydrateRoot` function attaches event handlers and application state to the existing DOM elements.
    * The React application becomes interactive.

**Example:**

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>
        {count} times
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

// server-side rendering
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
import App from './App.js';

const html = renderToString(<App />);
//send html to client.

// client-side hydration
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.js";

hydrateRoot(document.getElementById("root"), <App />);
```

## Explanation:

* The server generates static HTML for the `App` component.
* The client receives this HTML.
* `hydrateRoot` attaches the `onClick` event handler to the button, making it interactive.
* The React application is now fully functional on the client.

## Benefits:

* Faster initial page load.
* Improved SEO.
* Seamless transition from static to interactive content.
* Better user experience.
