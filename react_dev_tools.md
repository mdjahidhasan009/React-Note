# React Dev Tools
React developer tools let us inspect the component hierarchy, including component props and state. It exists both as a
browser extension(for chrome and firefox), and as standalone app(works with other environments including Safari, IE, and 
React Native).

The official extensions available for different browsers or environments.
* Chrome extension
* Firefox extension
* Standalone app(Safari, React Native, etc)

### Open devtools chrome for local files
If we open a local HTML file in our browser(file://...) then we must first open Chrome extension and check `Allow access
to file urls`.
