# Hook
In react hook is a special function that lets you "hook into" React features like **state**, **lifecycle method**, 
**context**, and more. Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8 that lets you use state and other React features without 
writing a class.

Hooks make functional components more powerful and flexible, allowing you to write cleaner and more reusable code.

Hook cover most of the case of class component lifecycle methods and also provide a way to use state and other React
features without writing a class. Also it cover almost all the case where we need **render props** and **higher order 
components**.
