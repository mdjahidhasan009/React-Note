The create-react-app CLI tool allows you to quickly create & run React applications with no configuration step.

Let's create Todo App using CRA:
```shell
# Installation
$ npm install -g create-react-app

# Create new project
$ create-react-app todo-app
$ cd todo-app

# Build, test and run
$ npm run build
$ npm run test
$ npm start
```

It includes everything we need to build a React app:

* React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
* Autoprefixed CSS, so you donâ€™t need -webkit- or other prefixes.
* A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
* A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
* A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
