# React Native
React is a JavaScript library, supporting both frontend web and being run on the server, for building user interfaces and
web applications.

React Native is a mobile framework that complies to native app components, allowing us to build native mobile applications
(iOS, Android and windows) in JavaScript that allows us to use react to build our components, and implements react under
the hood.

## Test React Native apps
React native can be tested only in mobile simulators like iOS and Android. We can run app in our mobile using expo app
(https://expo.io) where it syncs using QR code, our mobile and computer should be in the same wireless network.
