# Relay
Relay is similar to Redux in that they both use a single store. The main difference is that relay only manages state
originated from the server, and all access to the state is used via GraphQL queries (for reading data) and mutations
(for changing data). Relay caches the data for you and optimizes data fetching for you, by fetching only changed data 
and nothing more.
