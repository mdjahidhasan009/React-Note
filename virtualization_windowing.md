# Window Technique for Virtualization
Windowing is a technique that only renders a small subset of your rows at any given time, and can dramatically reduce
the time it takes to re-render the components as well as the number of DOM nodes created. If your application renders
long lists of data then this technique is recommended. Both react-window and react-virtualized are popular windowing 
libraries which provides several reusable components for displaying lists, grids, and tabular data
