## Redux Form: Managing Forms with Redux

Redux Form is a library that integrates React forms with Redux, allowing you to store all form state within the Redux
store. It can be used with standard HTML5 inputs or with UI frameworks like Material UI, React Widgets, and React 
Bootstrap.

## Main Features of Redux Form

Redux Form provides several key features:
* **Field Value Persistence:** Form field values are persisted in the Redux store. This makes it easy to manage form 
  data, even across component rerenders or page refreshes.
* **Validation and Submission:** Redux Form provides built-in mechanisms for both synchronous and asynchronous form
  validation. It also handles form submission, making it easy to send form data to your server.
* **Formatting, Parsing, and Normalization:** Redux Form allows you to format, parse, and normalize form field values. 
  This is useful for handling data in different formats or ensuring data consistency.**
