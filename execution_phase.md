# Execution Phases in React
### Render Phase
This is where React calls your component functions to determine what the UI should look like. During this phase, the DOM elements are not yet created or updated.
### Commit Phase
This is where React updates the DOM with the changes calculated during the render phase. This is when the actual DOM elements are created and inserted into the document.
