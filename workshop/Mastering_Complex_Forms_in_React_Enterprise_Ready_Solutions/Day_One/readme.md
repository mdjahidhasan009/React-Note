# Mastering Complex Forms in React: Enterprise-Ready Solutions

## Problems we have with forms
* The contribution volume of a form in an application.
* The complexity and the common tasks handle by forms.
* The scope of forms.

## Here are the possible solutions we have
Till React 18 there was no built-in solutions.

From React 19 we have
* **Server Components** - The problem with actions is that for client side validation and user experience, we still have
  to rely on third-party libraries.
* **Third-party libraries** - React Hook Form, Formik, Redux Form, React Final Form, etc.

## Responsibility of a form
* Manage states for multiple (complex) fields.
* Track changes efficiently.
* Validate user inputs with a better UX.
* Initiate with pre-populated data.
* Handle submission or reset.

## Tools we are going to use
* React Hook Form
* Zod
* Shadcn(UI Library)


## In this workshop, we will:
* Show the better way to deal with forms.
* Explain the tools architectural pattern we are going to follow.
* Live demo of our end product.
